              <h2> Founder and Software Developer</h2>
              <p>Karina is the founder and software developer of Wisdom! She just finished her junior year at Oyster Bay high school! Karina found out her passion or coding the summer after her freshman year of high school after attending a coding course in Java at Columbia University’s summer immersions camp! She found coding to be such a brand new experience uncanny to anything else she has performed before. The next summer she went back to the same summer camp and took a Big data and machine learning course and learned the programming language of R, a statistical language. She genuinely found a passion and applied for Columbia’s Science Honors program and has taken a semester of Python with Paul Blaer and Neuroscience course. When it comes to STEM related subjects Karina is apart of her schools mathletes team and math Olympiad team, coding club, and is in the works for creating a women’s coding club! She is in her schools Mu Alpha Theta and Science honor society! She has truly found a passion for coding and knows: Java, Python, HTML, CSS, R, and C++. But her favorite languages are HTML and CSS!
