  Wisdom is a platform that is made up of teen girls who vary from high school students all the way until college students to mentor any age range of girls interested in STEM. Specifically we target coding; however, when it comes to guidance all of the girls on our team are strongly passionate and have an abundance of knowledge in STEM related fields. The way as to how we work: there are three different routes initially either coding in Java, Python, or HTML  CSS & JavaScript! A student will pick a language they would like to learn first and can either be paired with a mentor to guide and teach the student how to code and at the end the student would be able to either create their very own game or website all free of charge!</p>

              <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
              <p>Mission Statement:
Our goal is to shed light on women in stem and to teach and mentor young girls who have a passion to learn about coding which can be done virtually due to the Covid19 pandemic. Students can learn through how they prefer either alone with their own set of notes and are free to ask any questions at any time, or be paired with an experienced mentor and can ask an abundance amount of questions and be able to connect via zoom and learn about coding or even STEM related concepts all being done with no cost and simply for young girls to be educated in coding.
